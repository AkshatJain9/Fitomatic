# Group Assignment Checklist
The following markdown document is a checklist of items you **should** complete before submission of your assignment. This exists to help you keep track of all the requirements you must fulfil.

## Statement of Originality
- [ ] All members have read and signed the [statement of originality](./statement-of-originality.yml). Failure to do so will result in zero marks.
- [ ] All external code, assets or help received outside the group is documented in the [statement of originality](./statement-of-originality.yml).

## GitLab
- [ ] Link to GitLab repository provided to the course.
- [ ] Commits use your own account. Failing to do this may result in zero marks.
- [ ] Must have the relevant marking tutors added as 'maintainers'.

## Features Checklist
- [ ] At least 4 features classified as 'easy'.
- [ ] At least 2 features classified as 'medium'.
- [ ] At least 1 feature classified as 'hard'.

## APK
- [ ] A working standalone APK is included in the GitLab repo, i.e., an APK that can be loaded and execute correctly on an AVD.

## Report Checklist
- [ ] Have a markdown report document titled 'report.md' on your GitLab. We advise you to use the provided template when writing your report (it will help you cover everything necessary).

## Individual Reflections
