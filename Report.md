# Team ACE Report - AJSMDLLZ

**Problem Statement:**  
After spending over two years in lockdown under various restrictions it has made it very difficult to socialise with others and leave the house. Our app helps promote social good by facilitating an environment that encourages an active and healthy lifestyle. Fitomatic is a social exercising app, where users are able to interact with others in an active environment.

u728072, Akshat Jain, I contributed approximately 25% of the code. The following are my contributions:
* Set up and configured Firestore Database, Image Storage Database and User Authentication Database for use.
* Created all of the Peer-to-Peer Messaging mechanism from the back-end, including reading from input fields, updating the firebase, and retrieving the messages previously sent. This also included filtering blocked users. I then later worked with Leon to transfer all of this logic to Recycle Feeds so that it would fit the UI theme. The following was written by myself;
  * DirectMessage.java (excl. populateMessages)
  * MessageFragment.java
* Inspired heavily by the initial tokeniser logic created by Shaazaan, I created the full search mechanism, including the Tokeniser (with the Iterator Design Pattern), Parser (including the Grammar) and DBQuery.java which creates a Firestore Query Object. So in total, the following classes.
  * DBQuery.java
  * Expressions Folder
  * KeywordList.java (Used in Tokeniser)
  * Token.java
  * SearchParser.java
  * SearchTokenizer.java (Built from Shaazaan’s initial version)
* Storing all user data in Firestore store database in the registration phase. This also included storing the user profile picture in a separate database.
  * ChooseInterests.java (Line 31-43)
  * Registration.java
  * ProfileCreation.java (Excl. onCreate())
* Created a mechanism for querying posts from the database to be displayed on the main feed, the profile page (following posts), the user’s own posts. Similarly, also added a mechanism to retrieve all user objects for display on the message fragment.
  * PostFactory.java (createPostfromDBSnapshot & createPostfromDBQuerySnapshot)
  * HomeFragment.java (76-86, 120-125)
  * ProfileFragment.java (133-147)
  * MessageFragment.java (73-105) 
* Created the AVL tree which stores the posts queried in the database in a sequential matter (from most likes to least) in an efficient manner. Also made this data structure usable with the UI (working with Leon)
  * AVLPosts.java
  * HomeFragment.java (120-125)

## Conflict Resolution Protocol

Find a neutral member for the given issue to delegate a discussion between the disagreeing parties. Construct a positives and negatives list outlining the key aspects of the conflict, combine ideas where possible and make compromises to solve the issue. However, if the conflict still continues hear all sides of the argument in full and hold a final group vote where a solution will be made based on assignment specifications and mutual compromise.

## Application Description

Fitomatic is a social media application encouraging users to socialise in a group or one-on-one fitness activity. Users are able to view, follow, like and search from thousands of different posts on the home feed. These posts include the activity participants will do, when and where it will occur along with additional information. Posts are broken down into three distinct categories an individual post (one-on-one fitness activity), a small group post and a large group post targeted for big events and fundraisers. 

Users first create a profile by completing their login credentials via an email and password then select various active interests. Finally completing their profile with identifiable information such as name, gender, age and a description. After completing a profile users are able to fully utilise the application. The application involves four main fragments, the home feed, a peer to peer messaging service, create a post and profile view. From there users can follow posts, message individuals, create their own events and view their list of following posts on their profile page. 

On the home feed users are able to view, follow, like and search from thousands of different posts. On the peer-to-peer messaging fragment users are able to individually message other users as well as being able to block others which will remove them from the messaging view. On the post fragment, users can view their own created posts as well as create new posts. When a user creates a new post, a subfragment view is displayed where individual, small group or large group posts can be selected. Each post type has differences between them and with the use of a factory method post creation is standardised. Finally, on the profile fragment users can view their profile picture and name towards the top of the screen and view their following posts below.

Fitomatic is a gateway to socialise with others while in an active environment promoting a healthy lifestyle.

**Application Use Cases and or Examples**

Fitomatic is targeted toward people of all ages. Individual users looking for a partner in their exercising routines or small group sporting activities as well as catering for large events directed towards fundraisers. On a social level, we want to promote physical activity for all ages. Especially for younger people, who seem to have health problems earlier on, we would love for them to use this app and start their fitness journey.

Timmy wants a buddy to go on afternoon runs with
* Timmy makes an individual post stating he wants a running partner who is available for afternoon runs.
* Other users can follow/like the post to get in contact with Timmy.
* After choosing a running partner Timmy can send over more details such as the location and equipment required through the peer to peer messaging service.
* After the activity concludes Timmy can keep in touch with the peer to peer messaging service or accept other users.

Steve wants to play a game of soccer with others
* Steve creates a small group post outlining where and when he would like to play soccer.
* Other users can follow/like the post to save it if they want to participate.
* Steve can now enjoy his game of soccer with the other users.
* Participants of the soccer match can keep in touch with the peer to peer messaging service to organise future plans.

Fun Run ACT wants to create a fundraising running marathon
* Fun Run ACT can create an account with appropriate verifiable credentials
* Fun Run ACT can create a large group post stating all necessary information: when, where, cost of entry for the fundraising event.
* After the fundraising marathon Fun Run ACT can contact event winners and other users who want to interact with the organisation can through the peer to peer messaging service.

## Application UML

*[Replace the above with a class diagram. You can look at how we have linked an image here as an example of how you can do it too.]*

## Application Design and Decisions
I used the following data structures in my project:
1. ArrayList

   * Objective: It is used for storing interest, posts, blocked users and following posts for our Users. It is also used for storing liked posts, followers and activities for our Posts and messages in DirectMessage.java.
   * Locations: User.java, Post.java, EventActivity.java, SmallGroupActivity.java, DirectMessage.java, PostFragment.java, ProfileFragment.java
   * Reasons:
     * Easily resizable if a user wants to like/follow a post or block a user.
     * Similarly useful for what we want out of our Posts, constantly changing values and sizes.
2. HashMap
  * Objective: It is used for storing interest, posts, blocked users and following posts for our Users. It is also used for storing liked posts, followers and activities for our Posts and messages in DirectMessage.java.
   * Locations: User.java, Post.java, EventActivity.java, SmallGroupActivity.java, DirectMessage.java, PostFragment.java, ProfileFragment.java
   * Reasons:
     * Easily resizable if a user wants to like/follow a post or block a user.
     * Similar
3. List
4. AVL Tree

## Summary of Known Errors and Bugs

1. *Loading Profile Picture*
* There is a small delay when you start the “ProfileFragment.java” activity and the user profile picture displaying. This does not cause application issues just a minor inconvenience.
2. *Following deleted posts*
* If a user follows a post and it is then deleted the user will not be able to view their profile page without the app crashing. (Note we haven’t actually implement the ability to delete posts this is just an issue if it were to be implemented)
3. *Rapidly switching between the fragments in the navigation*
* If a user rapidly switches between the fragments in the bottom navigation bar, the app crashes. Is not replicated on the post creation navigation bar and so is likely an issue with firebase e.g. too many requests to handle.
4. *Creating a new user and not finishing the process*
* If a user creates a new email and password but don’t fill out the rest of the registration and back out, the user will not be able to access their profile without the app crashing.
