# Team ACE Report - AJSMDLLZ

**Problem Statement:**  
After spending over two years in lockdown under various restrictions it has made it very difficult to socialise with others and leave the house. Our app helps promote social good by facilitating an environment that encourages an active and healthy lifestyle. Fitomatic is a social exercising app, where users are able to interact with others in an active environment.

*u7283219, Shaazaan Majeed, I contributed approximately 25% to the project. The following are my contributions:
Heavily involved with most aspects of the project. Including overall code design and implementation, report writing, software testing, proposing various design patterns and implementing a factory method.*
* Code Implementation: Created the factory design pattern for standardising post creation between three concrete post classes.
  * Post.java
  * SingleActivity.java
  * SmallGroupActivity.java
  * EventActivity.java
  * PostFactory.java
* Code Implementation: Created original Tokenizer with deprecated grammar, which was expanded on by Akshat. Git commit version (https://gitlab.cecs.anu.edu.au/u7284072/comp2100-group-assignment-ajsmdllz/-/tree/a4e9d9effc0f154356f2fa11c8f167cccdbba609/app/src/main/java/com/ajsmdllz/fitomatic)

  * Summary of known errors and bugs
  * Team meetings
* Miscellaneuos:
  * Created and maintained the group discord server for project management and team communications.

*u728072, Akshat Jain, I contributed approximately 25% of the code. The following are my contributions:*
* Set up and configured Firestore Database, Image Storage Database and User Authentication Database for use.
* Created all of the Peer-to-Peer Messaging mechanism from the back-end, including reading from input fields, updating the firebase, and retrieving the messages previously sent. This also included filtering blocked users. I then later worked with Leon to transfer all of this logic to Recycle Feeds so that it would fit the UI theme. The following was written by myself;
  * DirectMessage.java (excl. populateMessages)
  * MessageFragment.java
* Inspired heavily by the initial tokeniser logic created by Shaazaan, I created the full search mechanism, including the Tokeniser (with the Iterator Design Pattern), Parser (including the Grammar) and DBQuery.java which creates a Firestore Query Object. So in total, the following classes.
  * DBQuery.java
  * Expressions Folder
  * KeywordList.java (Used in Tokeniser)
  * Token.java
  * SearchParser.java
  * SearchTokenizer.java (Built from Shaazaan’s initial version)
* Storing all user data in Firestore store database in the registration phase. This also included storing the user profile picture in a separate database.
  * ChooseInterests.java (Line 31-43)
  * Registration.java
  * ProfileCreation.java (Excl. onCreate())
* Created a mechanism for querying posts from the database to be displayed on the main feed, the profile page (following posts), the user’s own posts. Similarly, also added a mechanism to retrieve all user objects for display on the message fragment.
  * PostFactory.java (createPostfromDBSnapshot & createPostfromDBQuerySnapshot)
  * HomeFragment.java (76-86, 120-125)
  * ProfileFragment.java (133-147)
  * MessageFragment.java (73-105) 
* Created the AVL tree which stores the posts queried in the database in a sequential matter (from most likes to least) in an efficient manner. Also made this data structure usable with the UI (working with Leon)
  * AVLPosts.java
  * HomeFragment.java (120-125)
* Created a mechanism to send direct notifications to a user's device using the Firebase Messaging service. This was ultimately removed as it did not contribute to our overall app design

## Conflict Resolution Protocol

Find a neutral member for the given issue to delegate a discussion between the disagreeing parties. Construct a positives and negatives list outlining the key aspects of the conflict, combine ideas where possible and make compromises to solve the issue. However, if the conflict still continues hear all sides of the argument in full and hold a final group vote where a solution will be made based on assignment specifications and mutual compromise.

## Application Description

Fitomatic is a social media application encouraging users to socialise in a group or one-on-one fitness activity. Users are able to view, follow, like and search from thousands of different posts on the home feed. These posts include the activity participants will do, when and where it will occur along with additional information. Posts are broken down into three distinct categories an individual post (one-on-one fitness activity), a small group post and a large group post targeted for big events and fundraisers. 

Users first create a profile by completing their login credentials via an email and password then select various active interests. Finally completing their profile with identifiable information such as name, gender, age and a description. After completing a profile users are able to fully utilise the application. The application involves four main fragments, the home feed, a peer to peer messaging service, create a post and profile view. From there users can follow posts, message individuals, create their own events and view their list of following posts on their profile page. 

On the home feed users are able to view, follow, like and search from thousands of different posts. On the peer-to-peer messaging fragment users are able to individually message other users as well as being able to block others which will remove them from the messaging view. On the post fragment, users can view their own created posts as well as create new posts. When a user creates a new post, a subfragment view is displayed where individual, small group or large group posts can be selected. Each post type has differences between them and with the use of a factory method post creation is standardised. Finally, on the profile fragment users can view their profile picture and name towards the top of the screen and view their following posts below.

Fitomatic is a gateway to socialise with others while in an active environment promoting a healthy lifestyle.

## Application Design and Decisions

*Please give clear and concise descriptions for each subsections of this part. It would be better to list all the concrete items for each subsection and give no more than `5` concise, crucial reasons of your design. Here is an example for the subsection `Data Structures`:*

*I used the following data structures in my project:*

1. *LinkedList*

   * *Objective: It is used for storing xxxx for xxx feature.*

   * *Locations: line xxx in XXX.java, ..., etc.*

   * *Reasons:*

     * *It is more efficient than Arraylist for insertion with a time complexity O(1)*

     * *We don't need to access the item by index for this feature*

2. ...

3. ...
