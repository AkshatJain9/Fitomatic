### Firebase Tutor Accounts

Username: tutor1@gmail.com, Password: testing1 <br>
Username: tutor2@gmail.com, Password: testing2 <br>
Username: tutorone@gmail.com, Password: password <br>

Note: although we provided some user accounts as requested, fully functioning account creation is included which can be used to create new user accounts.

We simulated peer to peer messaging between the first two tutor accounts.

### Firebase Data Instances 

We were unable to export the data using the free account on Firebase. After speaking with Cathy via email we added the following users to the Firebase database itself. The following accounts were added to the Firebase maintainers (cheungpokwing@gmail.com, u6731451@anu.edu.au, u6457067@anu.edu.au) which have access to the backend data instances.
